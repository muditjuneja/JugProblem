Angularjs Application given to me as a task by GreedyGame.

Paths : 

1 - "#/track"

    a). It allows one to retrieve all the tracks.
    b). When a user clicks on "Add new Track" a form will open up and a user can fill the form to add new track.
    c). When a  user clicks on the track a form will openup for its updation.
    d). For adding or updating genres use csv of genreid like - 22,19,34
    e). It also allows a user to  search for a track by using the search box

2 - "#/genre"

    a). It allows one to retrive all the genres.
    b). When a user clicks on "Add new Genre" a form will open up and a user can fill the form to add new genre.
    c). When a  user clicks on the genre a form will open up for the updation of its name.

PS . 

For the rating system I am using the ceiling function like for rating of 2.5 the no of stars that will be shown will be 3.
